Search](../graph_search)

Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm calculates the shortest distance between
vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. *Shortest Path* is
defined as the path for which the sum of the edge weights is the smallest.

Recall the [shortest path](../graph_search/README.md#bfs---shortest-path)
algorithm from the graph search section.
