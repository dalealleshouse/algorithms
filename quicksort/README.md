# Quick Sort

Sorting algorithm that is prevalent in practice. Although it has the same runtime on average as merge sort, in practice
it will execute faster due to reduced memory requirements.

## Runtime
O(n log(2, n)) _on average_

## Input
Unsorted array

## Output
Sorted array

## Pseudo Code

Assumptions:
- All input array items are distinct

Inputs:
- A = input array 
- n = length of A

``` pseudo
if n <= 1:
    return
blah
```
