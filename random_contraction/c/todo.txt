Add error handling/checking into random_contraction.c

Add a way to track which nodes are collapsed so that we can output the min cut
along with it's size

Graph_FromFile assumes the graph is undirected, but it does so in a rather hacky
way. While adding edges, it ignores edges with a vertex higher than the current
vertex. It would be a good idea to rethink this code

        while (edge > 0) {
            _AddVertexIfMissing(self, edge);

            if (edge > vertex)
                Graph_AddEdge(self, vertex, edge);

            edge = strtoul(remaining, &remaining, 10);
        }
