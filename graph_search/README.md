Any aspiring computer scientist should make understanding graph search
algorithms a priority because of their ubiquity. Graph search is a common
problem in computer science because of it's wide range of applications. Luckily,
there are many blazingly fast solutions. The purpose of graph search is to
identify vertices *reachable* from a specified vertex. A vertex is reachable
from another vertex if there is a path through the graph connecting the two
vertices.
